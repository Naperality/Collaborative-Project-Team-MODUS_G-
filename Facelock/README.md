# Face Lock Project
This is project created by Modus_G that has three files for face registration (face_taker), face training (face_train), and tracking (facetracker). It also uses a servo and pantilt for tracking the faceon live video feed using camera while it is connected through arduino. The servos both servo_x and servo_y are controlled by arduino using firmata library (servo_firmata).

Requirements:
- opencv
- cvzone
- pyfirmata
- numpy
- pillow
